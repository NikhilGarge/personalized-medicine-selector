# Personalized Medicine Treatment Selection Using Simulated Genomic Data
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict optimal diabetes treatments using simulated genomic data. Implemented data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation in R and Python. Skills: R, Python, machine learning, genomics

## Overview

This project demonstrates a computational framework for **personalized treatment selection** using simulated genetic variants (SNPs) and machine learning. The primary focus is on leveraging genomic data to identify the most suitable treatment for individual patients, with a case study in **Type 2 Diabetes**[1][3].

## Key Features

- **Simulated Genomic Data:**  
  Generates synthetic SNP datasets to mimic patient genetic profiles.

- **SNP Selection:**  
  Identifies top genetic variants associated with treatment response using statistical and machine learning methods[3].

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  Applies decision trees, ensemble methods, and the `model4you` R library (including pmforest and MOB models) to estimate personalized treatment effects and predict clinical responses[2][4][5].

- **Personalized Treatment Recommendation:**  
  Predicts the most effective treatment for each patient based on their unique genetic profile.
